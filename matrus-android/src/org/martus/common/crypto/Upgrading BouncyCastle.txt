Currently we are using bcprov-jdk14-128.jar
When we upgrade assuming that the serialVersionUID issue has been resolved by implementing
our own read/write objects instead of using Java's Serialization, the following steps are needed:

1. Update martus-thirdparty/libext/BouncyCastle/
	bin -> Copy bcprov-jdk14-XXX.jar
	Source -> Copy bcprov-jdk14-XXX.zip
	license -> Extract from the above zip file the License.html
2. Projects martus-common, and martus-bc-jce Properties :Build Path need to point to the new Jar in ThirdParty.
3. We verify that the signature inside the bcprov-jdk14-XXX.jar matches the one in org.martus.common.crypto
   To do this extract from the bcprov-jdk14-XXX.jar the file Meta-Inf\BCKEY.SF and copy it into org.martus.common.crypto but rename it to BCKEY.SIG
4. In org.martus.common.crypto.MartusSecurity update the Constant BCPROV_JAR_FILE_NAME to the new JAR name.
5. In the martus project, edit build.properties and change the bouncycastle.version variable to the new jar XXX value (e.g. 135).
